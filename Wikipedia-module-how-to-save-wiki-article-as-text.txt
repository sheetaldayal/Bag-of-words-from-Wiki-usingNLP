Wikipedia is a Python library that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia.
Search Wikipedia, get article summaries, get data like links and images from a page, and more. 

Here I've scraped an article on "Python programming language":
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
I saved the extracted article as text file named "Bag-of-words-Python-Wiki" on my computer.



import wikipedia
p = wikipedia.page("Python programming language")
print(p.url)
print(p.title)
content = p.content
#print(content)    #It's a large text so I avoided printing it

file = (r'C:\Bag-of-words-Python-Wiki.txt')
#Save the text from wikipedia
with open (file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(content)
